Once upon a time, there was a bear who loved to dance.
He spoke to every creature in the forest, great and small, to learn their dances.
During this time, he learned to lie low and skitter with the beetles, 
shake in the wind like the aspens, and hop with the best of rabbits.
But one day, he realized he had learned all there was to learn from the forest.
