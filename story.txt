Once upon a time, there was a bear who loved to dance.
He spoke to every creature in the forest, great and small, to learn their dances.
During this time, he learned to lie low and skitter with the beetles, 
shake in the wind like the aspens, and hop with the best of rabbits.
But one day, he realized he had learned all there was to learn from the forest.

The bear decided to leave the forest and to seek knowledge from all four corners of the flat earth that's shaped like a rhombus. 
He first traveled north, to learn the ways of his polar cusins. 
Along the way, he learned to swim with the sharks, and fly with arctic terns.
When he arrived at the northern corner, a polar bear came up to him and said in a thick brooklyn accent, "cousin Robbbie, so you want to learn the arctic shuffle?"
The bear's name was not Robbie, but that did not bother him as he was here for to learn the dance of the polar bear.
The bear trained for days but could not perfect the arctic shuffle. 
He was told to retreave the ingredients for spaghetti and meat squares from the other three corners of the flat earth that's shaped like a rhombus.
Only then can he posess the power to perfect the arctic shuffe.
